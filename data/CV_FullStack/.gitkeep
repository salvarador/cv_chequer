# CV Directory Structure
# 
# Place your CV PDF files in the following subdirectories:
# 
# CV_FullStack/
# ├── EPAM/          - EPAM candidate CVs
# ├── SR/            - Senior role candidate CVs  
# └── Coderio/       - Coderio candidate CVs
#
# Example files you can test with:
# - CV_FullStack/EPAM/CV_John_Doe.pdf
# - CV_FullStack/SR/CV_Jane_Smith.pdf
# 
# This .gitkeep file ensures the directory structure is preserved in git
# while actual CV files are ignored for privacy.
